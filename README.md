cd odc

# Setup environment variables (edit as needed)
SRC_DIR=$(pwd)
BUILD_DIR=build
INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local
export eckit_DIR=$INSTALL_DIR # set to eckit install prefix

# Create the the build directory
mkdir $BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR

# Run ecbuild (CMake)
ecbuild --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR -- $SRC_DIR

# Build and install
make -j10
make test # optional
make install

# Check installation

## Usage

Include the `odc` headers like so:

```c

#include "odc/api/odc.h"

int main() {
   odc_initialise_api();
   return 0;
}
```

Make sure to reference the linked library when compiling:

```

## Build Documentation

The documentation is generated using Sphinx.

First, make sure that `Doxygen` module is available, and then install Python dependencies in your environment:

```sh
cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then build the documentation by using **make**:

```sh
cd docs
make html
```

The built HTML documentation will be available under the `docs/_build/html/index.html` path.
