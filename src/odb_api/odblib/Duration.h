  //! This class represents time durations.
  /*! 
   *  Internally, a Duration is a 64-bit signed integer.
   *  A Duration can be positive, negative or zero.
   *
   *  Durations can be compared or used to modify a DateTime.
   *  The differece between two DateTimes is a Duration.
   *
   *  Durations can be input or output (including via the stream operators
   *  <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> and  <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>) as retricted ISO 8601
   *  duration strings:
   *  - [-]P[dD][T[hH][mM][sS]]
   *
   *  Here, square brackets indicate optional content, and "d", "h", "m" and
   *  "s" represent  non-negative integers giving the number of days, hours
   *  minutes and seconds in the Duration. At least one of these quantities
   *  must be present. If "T" appears, then at least one of H, M or S must
   *  be present. Negative durations (which are not part of ISO 8601) are
   *  represented by an initial "-".
   *
   *  For example, the duration "1 day 12 hours and 5 minutes" could be
   *  represented as any of:
   *  - P1DT12H5M
   *  - P1DT12H300S
   *  - PT36H300S
   *  - PT2165M
   *  - PT129900S
   *
   *  On output, the first format will be used.
